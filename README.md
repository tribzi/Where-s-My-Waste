# Where's-My-Waste
An app to show NYC residents where their waste ends up and how it gets there. Using NYC's open data the tool will help inform the public where their waste and recycling ends up, how far it travels, and how much it costs the city to dump it there.

See the Documentation for a more in depth project summary.
